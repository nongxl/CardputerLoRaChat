forked from nonik0/CardputerLoRaChat
I rebuild it on uiflow2 micropython to surport M5-LoRa-E220 module(region:CN and EUR¡ª¡ªthe nonik0's version is for M5-LoRa-E220-JP) and add a message log page¡£

## Hardware used:
- [M5 Cardputer](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stack-cardputer-kit-w-m5stamps3])
- [M5 E220 LoRa module](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/lora-unit-433mhz-with-antenna-e220) (optional if using ESP-NOW mode, see [Settings Tab Details](#settings-tab-details))

## Overview:
The interface is split into 6 tabs. The first three tabs are separate chat channels, the next tab shows the status of other users seen, and the last tab is Message Log. Press the tab key to switch between tabs. The system bar shows the current username, the signal strength of the user seen with the best signal strength and incoming and outgoing messages, and the Cardputer's current battery level. LoRa modules are currently configured using the default settings from the [LoRa modules's library](https://github.com/m5stack/M5-LoRa-E220). Modules must be configured initially to work, can do so in settings.

Brightness|Set display brightness [0-100]. If set very low, the display will automatically brighten when buttons are pressed.
Ping Mode|Send an occassional ping when not sending messages to show presence to other users.
Repeat Mode|Repeat back messages received. Just a testing function for now.
ESP-NOW Mode|Use the Wifi radio (using ESP-NOW protocol) to chat instead of LoRa! The range will be lower. :)

## TODO
See TODOs in code for now.

**ideas:**
- ACK Mode: know when users receive your message, resend/catch up?
- Mesh Mode: repeat messages from other users to extend range
- message scrolling
- saving chats to SD
